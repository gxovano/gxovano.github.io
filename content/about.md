title: "About me"
draft: false

My name is Geovano Lago Quatrin ([gxovano](https://github.com/gxovano)) and I work as IT Technician (government employee) at the Federal University of South Frontier (Chapecó, Santa Catarina, Brazil) since 2017 until nowadays. Since my first day at the institution so far I've devoted myself to new challenges and to learning new tools and technologies to apply at the institutional reality.   
I personally see myself as a self-learner, being able to learn and put in practice something by myself. The recognition of this matter happened in the context of the government employment.   
Towards that recognition I've learned to value the maintenance of a good organization and documentation about projects, ideas and tasks. That's the main reason of being of this page.
